## Data Project 2 - Twitter Bot
Welcome to our Air Quality Twitter bot! 

## Overview
The purpose of our project was to build a Twitter bot that would respond to a user's tweet with Air Quality and temperature information for the specified city. We created a Python script that gets data from an API and parses that data to return useful information the the user. The Twitter account handle is @AirQualityBot1

## Instructions
1. Send a tweet to our Twitter handle (@AirQualityBot1) specifying a city, state, and country to receive information about. You should include the information in the following format: /City/State/CountryAbbreviation/. Make sure you capitalize the city and state and the entire country abbreviation. Here is an example tweet: "@AirQualityBot1 /Charlottesville/Virginia/USA/"
2. If you receive an error message in response, that means you did not enter the city, state and country abbreviation in the correct format. Please send another tweet ensuring that you are using the correct format â€“ don't forget to capitalize!
3. If you forget how to talk to the bot, send a tweet to the account saying 'help'. You will get a reply to your tweet with instructions on how to communicate with the bot. Here is an example tweet: "@AirQualityBot1 help"

## Process
A simple fastapi application was containerized in order to be deployed to AWS Lightsail as a container service. The fastapi we wrote has an endpoint "/start" that when visited will start up the bot--tweet away. If desired, the bot can be shut down by visiting the "/stop" endpoint.

## Errors
One error I couldn't explain was the tweepy "stream" unexpectedly stopped working for me. After leaving the code overnight (unchanged), the next day the stream function wouldn't work on my computer (but worked on my partners). No errors were thrown either, it simply...didn't create a stream anymore. All I did to fix the error was open the code in Windows instead of WSL.
Another error we encountered was with trying to use the Flask API framework. When I used WSL for developement, I could run the app no problem, however, when I switched to Windows to fix the previous issue the app wouldn't run. My partner and I kept getting the same "can't find '__main__' module in..." error and spun our wheels trying to fix it. We switched to the fastapi framework and that works like a charm.
